Fashion MNIST Image Classification with TensorFlow/Keras
This project demonstrates a simple neural network trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras for image classification. Fashion MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images, consisting of 60,000 training examples and 10,000 testing examples, each example being a 28x28 grayscale image associated with a label from 10 classes representing fashion items.
